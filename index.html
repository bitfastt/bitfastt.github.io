                        areas:
                        <br>
                        <br>- Command, Control, and Communications (C3) and Battle Management
                        <br> - Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Electronic Warfare
                        <br> - Warfighter Systems and Human-Machine Teaming
                        <br>
                        <br> Gain the advantage of integrated mission expertise, innovative partnerships, and technical talent for mission success. By using truly open architectures and government-owned APIs, this keeps the DoD in control of its data, insights,
                        and analytics.
