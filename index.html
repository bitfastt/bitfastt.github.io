                        <br>Digital Battlespace solutions speed up the decision cycle by delivering smart technologies to empower a truly joint force. We provide modular, scalable, and flexible solutions to seize decision advantage faster. These solutions
                        are designed to align with the Department of Defense (DoD) mission, creating systems that are open, integrated, and smarter from enterprise to edge. These solutions focus on addressing the DoDâ€™s most vital challenges in three key
                        areas:
                        <br>
                        <br>- Command, Control, and Communications (C3) and Battle Management
                        <br> - Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Electronic Warfare
                        <br> - Warfighter Systems and Human-Machine Teaming
                        <br>
                        <br> Gain the advantage of integrated mission expertise, innovative partnerships, and technical talent for mission success. By using truly open architectures and government-owned APIs, this keeps the DoD in control of its data, insights,
                        and analytics.
